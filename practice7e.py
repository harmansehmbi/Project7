 Real World:
      Object: is anything which you can see and touch which is real. that is why it is called real time entity.
      Class: is drawing of an object. is description / representation how an object will look like.

    what will you think of first ??
    object , than class

    OOPS Principle
    1. Think of an object
    2. Draw Object
    3. Create Real object by looking drawing

Computer Science:
     Object: Multi Value Container. if we wish to customise MVC we will create Objects

     we need another multi value container for customisation ....

    Class: Is a textual representation of an Object.

    eg. Geometry Box
         all pencils - Homogeneous MVC
         pencils, eraser, sharpner - Hetrogenous MVC
